Running the Project Methode :

1- Open SWI Prolog Console.
2- Consult or Compile the (Knowledge.pl) file 
  (That Contains different Intial States & Possible Moves in for Any State) 
Or use (load_files("(File Path)\\ Knowledge.pl").) rule.
3- Consult or Compile the (Game_Engine.pl) file
  (That Contains The game engine (rules,predicts) & it's modules) 
Or use (load_files("(File Path)\\ Game_Engine.pl").) rule.
Note : (Knowledge.pl) file & (Game_Engine.pl) file must two be compiled
	    before running or the either the game engine won't find needed 
		knowledge(Intial States & Possible Moves) to process 
	    or the knowledge won't be processed.
4- Enter the minimal Score For user agent to win 
  (Enter a number then press dot(.) then press Enter).
5- Enter the maximum number of moves the user agent allowed to play
  (Enter a number then press dot(.) then press Enter).
6- the first 7 moves of user agent & the first 7 response computer agent
  (14 moves) of the total output will appear.
7- Enter any Character (Enter a char then press dot(.) then press Enter).
8- the following 14 moves of will appear.
9- go to step (7) until total output is finished. 
Note : the swi prolog console has a limit for output 
      (which is almost can show 7 moves result at max)
	   that's why it shows only 7 moves of total output at time until 
	   so you can check total output parts without any part overrides 
	   other due to console limitions.
